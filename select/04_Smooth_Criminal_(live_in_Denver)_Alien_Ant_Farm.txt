As he came into the window
It was the sound of a crescendo
He came into her apartment
He left the bloodstains on the carpet
She was sitiing on the table
He could see she was unable
So she ran into the bedroom
She was struck down
It was her doom

Annie are you ok?
Are you ok?
Are you ok Annie?
Annie are you ok?
Are you ok?
Are you ok Annie?
Annie are you ok?
Are you ok?
Are you ok Annie?

Annie are you ok?
Won't you tell us, that you're ok
There's a sign at the window
That he struck you
A crescendo, Annie
He came into your apartment
He left the bloodstains on the carpet
Then you ran into the bedroom
You were struck down
It was your doom

Annie are you ok?
Are you ok?
Are you ok Annie?
Annie are you ok?
Are you ok?
Are you ok Annie?
Annie are you ok?
Are you ok?
Are you ok Annie?

You've been hit by
You've been struck by
A smooth criminal
So they came into the outway
It was sunday
What a black day
I could made a salutation
Sounding heartbeats
Intimidations

Annie are you ok?
Are you ok?
Are you ok Annie?
Annie are you ok?
Are you ok?
Are you ok Annie?
Annie are you ok?
Are you ok?
Are you ok Annie?

Annie are you ok?
Won't you tell us, that you're ok
There's a sing at the window
That he struck you
A crescendo Annie
He came into your apartment
He left the bloodstains on the carpet
Then you ran into the bedroom
You were struck down
It was your doom

Annie are you ok?
Are you ok?
Are you ok Annie?
You've been hit by
You've been struck by
A smooth criminal

Annie are you ok?
(I don't know!)
Won't you tell us that you're ok
(I don't know!)
Knew by the sound of the window
(I don't know!)
That he struck you
A crescendo Annie
(I don't know!)
He came into your apartment
(I don't know!)
Left the bloodstains on the carpet
(I don't know why baby!)
Then you ran into the bedroom
(I don't know!)
You were struck down
It was your doom

Annie are you ok?

As He Came Into The Window
It Was The Sound
Of A Crescendo
He Came Into Her Apartment
He Left The Bloodstains
On The Carpet
She Ran Underneath The Table
He Could See She Was Unable
So She Ran Into The Bedroom
She Was Struck Down
It Was Her Doom
Annie Are You Ok
So, Annie Are You Ok
Are You Ok
Annie Annie Are You Ok
So, Annie Are You Ok
Are You Ok
Annie Annie Are You Ok
So, Annie Are You Ok
Are You Ok
Annie Annie Are You Ok
So, Annie Are You Ok
Are You Ok, Annie
(Annie Are You Ok)
(Will You Tell Us
That You're Ok)
(There's A Sign In The Window)
(That He Struck You-A
Crescendo Annie)
(He Came Into Your Apartment)
(He Left The Bloodstains
On The Carpet)
(Then You Ran
Into The Bedroom)
(You Were Struck Down)
(It Was Your Doom)
Annie Are You Ok
So, Annie Are You Ok
Are You Ok Annie
Annie Are You Ok
So, Annie Are You Ok
Are You Ok Annie
Annie Are You Ok
So, Annie Are You Ok
Are You Ok Annie
You've Been Hit By
You've Been Hit By-
A Smooth Criminal
So They Came
Into The Outway
It Was Sunday
What A Black Day
Mouth To Mouth
Resus-Citation
Sounding Heartbeats
Intimidations
Annie Are You Ok
So, Annie Are You Ok
Are You Ok Annie
Annie Are You Ok
So, Annie Are You Ok
Are You Ok Annie
Annie Are You Ok
So, Annie Are You Ok
Are You Ok Annie
Annie Are You Ok
So, Annie Are You Ok
Are You Ok Annie

(Will You Tell Us
That You're Ok)
(There's A Sign
In The Window)
(That He Struck You-A
Crescendo Annie)
(He Came Into Your Apartment)

On The Carpet)

Into The Bedroom)
(You Were Struck Down)

A Smooth Criminal)
